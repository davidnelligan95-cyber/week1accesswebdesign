                <h1>DJ Nellie</h1>
                <p>My name is DJ Nellie, I am a hard dance DJ from the UK. I have been DJing for over 20 years and have played at some events in the UK. My love for music started at a young age and I have always been passionate about sharing my love for music with others. I specialise in hard house, hard trance, and hard dance music. I have a unique style that combines different genres of music to create a high-energy and exciting experience for my audience. I am always looking for new opportunities to play at events and clubs, so if you are interested in booking me for your event, please feel free to contact me through my website.</p>
